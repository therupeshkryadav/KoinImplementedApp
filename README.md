# KoinImplementedApp - Clean Architecture with Koin

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Clean Architecture** principles in an Android app using **Koin** for Dependency Injection (DI). It follows modern Android development practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability.

## Project Structure

The app follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer**: Handles data fetching and repository pattern.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic, use cases, and models.
- **Presentation Layer**: Includes UI components, navigation, and ViewModels.

### Key Features:
- **Koin for Dependency Injection**: This project leverages Koin to manage and inject dependencies across various layers.
- **Clean Architecture**: The project is organized into distinct layers, ensuring separation of concerns and making it easier to maintain and scale.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Utilizes Jetpack Compose for UI development, following modern Android design patterns.
- **Testable**: The app is structured to be easily testable with unit and instrumented tests.
- **Modular Design**: The project is designed with a modular approach, making it easier to add features and maintain code.

### Project Directory:
- **app/src/main/java/com/cleanarchitecture/app/**: Core app logic, including data handling, DI modules, domain use cases, and presentation logic (UI and ViewModels).
- **app/src/main/res/**: Resources such as layouts, themes, colors, and drawables.
- **gradle/**: Configuration files for managing Gradle dependencies and wrapper.

## Technologies Used:
- **Kotlin**
- **Koin (Dependency Injection)**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **Clean Architecture**
- **JUnit** (for testing)
